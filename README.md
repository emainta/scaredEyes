# Scared Eyes - Reactive Version
*Version 9.3*

Reactive visual I made in Processing. Those visual we made for this [seminar](https://youtu.be/Q1229V8ANIc), held in Politecnico di Milano on December 13th, 2019. The title of the seminar was **Percussions and emotions: an interactive performance**. 

## Abstract (of the seminar)

How can interactive technologies provide a contribute to enhance musical performances to convey emotions? The seminar is intended to offer a practical perspective on the conjunction between creative computing and musical performances. Vito Perrini and a group of students of the course of Creative Programming and Computing worked together to create a performance that will provide a contribute to the overall thinking raised by the question.
In the first part of the seminar, Vito Perrini will cover various aspects of the use of percussions in the process of conveying emotions by exploring rhythmic and timbral aspects and the students will provide an overview on the creative computing techniques implemented for the performance. The interactive performance will end the seminar.
A special talk will be also given by Jean Paul Carradori, well known international light and set designer. The talk will be a contribute on the use of innovative technologies in art with a special focus on light design.

## This visuals: the scared eyes

Fear is one of the primitive human emotion and, at those times, it was simply a survival tool. For this reason this emotion had to be transmitted in a fast and efficient way. One of those ways is through our eyes. Here we wanted to represent this particular using a scared face. 
When you are scared your eyes move frantically, your pupils shake, your irises often shrink. Someone is scared by the dark, some other by heavy sounds.

In this section thereâ€™s a realtime interaction with the performance, nothing is pre-programmed.
**Audio features** are extracted from the sound of the performance and the behaviour of the visuals depends on them.
Fear can also cause confusion. So audio triggers some elements of confusion on the screen, too.
